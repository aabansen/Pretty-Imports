# Pretty Imports
### A useless program for people with OCD.

#### It organizes your python imports into third party imports, built-in imports, local imports.

#### And did I forget to say it sorts them in alphabetical order?

## Usage

``` pip install stdlib-list ```

``` python3 pretty_imports.py <input.py> ```
